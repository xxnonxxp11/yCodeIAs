/**
 * Serializes launches against the shared Antigravity guest rootfs.
 *
 * Confirmed on a real device: a single `agy models` invocation completes in about 5 seconds, but two
 * `agy` processes started within the same second or so of each other - two one-shot checks, or a
 * one-shot check racing the interactive sign-in TUI's own startup - do not return, apparently stuck
 * indefinitely. The official CLI does its own state initialization on every launch (an SQLite
 * trajectory store, a keyring session), and that appears not to be safe for two guest processes to
 * race through at once. Every caller in this file blocks only from a background dispatcher thread;
 * nothing here is safe to call from the UI thread.
 *
 * The hang is specific to the PRoot/Android deployment, not the binary itself: measured on a native
 * host, three simultaneous one-shot `agy` runs all completed in about ten seconds with no
 * contention, and `lsof` showed the CLI holding only read-only config files and network sockets, no
 * exclusive lock. Because the deadlock cannot be reproduced or fixed from outside PRoot, the app
 * keeps serializing every launch; [serialize] lets a chat send queue behind an in-flight one rather
 * than fail, while [exclusive] keeps short probes like `models` fail-fast.
